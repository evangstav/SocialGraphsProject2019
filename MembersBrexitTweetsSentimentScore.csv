We have far more to gain than to lose(3/4) Within minutes of a vote for #Brexit CEO’s would be knocking down Chancellor Merkel’s door. Demanding access to the British market#Brexit is nothing to fear. To remain a member of the EU is to constrain our future, forgo control of our destiny & give up on opportunityTomorrow I will deliver my speech on #Brexit and what it would look like.
